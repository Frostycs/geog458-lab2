Narrative:

  The topic I decided to research is "what do people living in other cities
tweet about Seattle"? "Are the tweets different between Seattle residents and
others"? The search term I decided to go with was simply "Seattle". Four cities
in total are picked: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Seattle There are two
major reasons I wanted to do this. First, I wanted to know what people from
other cities talk about Seattle on the internet; second, what's the difference
in topics between people living in Seattle vs outside of Seattle?

  Comparing the work clouds, the 5 most similar words or phrases are: "Go",
"Out", "New Year", "Team", and "Time". For each city except Seattle, local names
and regions appeared a lot. For example, in the New York Word Cloud, "New" and
"York" appeared many times. One interesting observation is: "Portland" appeared
in all of the search results. Other than that, words like "Trip", "Play", and
"Travel" also appeared often.

  The time at which these tweets were posted had a strong influence on what the
content would be. Since Twitter only allows users to collect tweets within 7
days, the results are arguably more predictable. For example, the Chinese New
Year just passed when the search scripts were running, and many of the results
had something to do with the Lunar New Year. The reason "Go", "Team", and "play"
appeared in the result was likely because of the ice hockey games played
recently and those that will be played soon. This is especially the case for
New York because the New York Rangers lost to Seattle Kraken in November, and
the 2 teams are about to play again.

  The search strategy could be improved in many ways; the one that would have
the most significant impact would be to add more search terms, narrowing down
the search radius. The result of the performed search is too generic, there are
a lot of words that do not imply anything meaningful. If this research could
be done again, I would pick a critical time to research a special topic. One
example is: "why do people in other cities tweet about Seattle during the New
Year"? Another would be: "what do people in New York say about Seattle after
a hockey game between the 2 teams"?

  The result really surprised me, because I did not expect that the search time
would have so much impact on the topics. I had expected the most frequent words
to be travel-related, although this is somewhat true, other words appeared even
more frequently. First, I did not expect so many people would celebrate Chinese
New Year in the US online; second, I did not expect people from the cities to be
the most enthusiastic about their competitive sports teams. Additionally, people
from other places in the US seem to associate Seattle and Portland together
very much. Understandably, these 2 cities are the largest in the
Pacific-Northwest region, however, people seem to link them together so much
so that they appear on random tweets about one of them.
